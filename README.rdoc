= Snowflake

Rails gem for making each ActiveRecord a beautiful and unique snowflake by giving it a UUID.
Yeah I know, it might as well be MyFirstGem.git, right?  Because it is.

== Usage

= SYNOPSIS
  class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
    snowflake :column
  end
  END

That's it!  The column has to exist and be a string.
